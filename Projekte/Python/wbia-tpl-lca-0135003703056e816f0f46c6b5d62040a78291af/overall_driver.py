"""
This is a top-level driver for the LCA graph algorithm, written mostly
to illustrate use of the graph algorithm through small examples and
simulations. Of particular note there are two objects created here
that must be replaced by objects that are connected to "real"
information about animals:  the edge and id database, and the
generator for edges through calls to verifiers or calls to human
reviewers.

Three key files are needed here:

1. The configuration file.  See the config.ini example

2. The JSON file of recent verifier ground truth positive and negative
probability results. Note as a reminder that both the values of the
probabilities AND the relative fraction of positive and negative
ground truth samples are important here.

3. The request JSON file, which includes the simulated database, the
simulated edge generator and the actual query request.  See
request_example.json

Note that the first two will always be needed even if this is running
"for real", as will the actual query (with the request JSON).  So in
an non-simulation, only the database and edge generator object need to
be replaced.
